# simple benchmark model
function:
    - take training dataset (product-order level)
    - simple model: top x % most popular products
    - return list of products

function:
    - take top x % most popular product list
    - take test dataset (product-order level)
    - create prediction for each row (product-order)
    - reformat dataset into (order, product list)
    - output dataset

# simple classification model
function:
    - take training dataset (product-order level)
    - classification model: build classification fit based on features
    - features: aisle, department, order_number, dow, hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order
    - return model fit

function:
    - take model fit
    - take test dataset (product-order level)
    - create prediction for each row (product-order)
    - reformat dataset into (order, product list)
    - output dataset
